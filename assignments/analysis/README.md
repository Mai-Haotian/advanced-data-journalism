Analysis assignment
===================

This assignment is pretty wide open.

Your job is to analyze a set of data using some of the tools we discussed in class (or others that you find on your own) and document that analysis in a Jupyter notebook.

There are no requirements for how long or complex the analysis has to be, but you should outline at least three story ideas or interesting findings that result.

Use this an an excuse to explore tools like [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), or check out other analysis tools ([agate](https://agate.readthedocs.io/en/1.6.0/), [ggplot](http://ggplot.yhathq.com)) that you might find interesting.

Included in this folder is a simple dataset outlining crime statistics from a number of college campuses. It's a little old, but you can feel free to use it. Otherwise you are welcome to analyze a dataset of your choice.

This assignment is due **next Wednesday, April 19**.
